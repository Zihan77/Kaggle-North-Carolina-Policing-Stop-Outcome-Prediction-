# About Dataset

# Context:
On a typical day in the United States, police officers make more than 50,000 traffic stops. The Stanford Open Policing Project team is gathering, analyzing, and releasing records from millions of traffic stops by law enforcement agencies across the country. Their goal is to help researchers, journalists, and policymakers investigate and improve interactions between police and the public.

# Inspiration:
How predictable are the stop rates? Are there times and places that
reliably generate stops?
Concerns have been raised about jurisdictions using civil forfeiture
as a funding mechanism rather than to properly fight drug
trafficking. Can you identify any jurisdictions that may be
exhibiting this behavior?
